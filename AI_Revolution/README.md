## ❓ Common Question: “If AI Can Code, Why Should We?”

**Answer:**

AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement. Here’s why learning to code still matters:

- AI can generate code, but **humans define the logic, structure, and purpose** behind it.  
- Developers ensure **security, performance, and scalability** — AI cannot fully handle that.  
- New roles are emerging — **Prompt Engineer, AI Integrator, AI Ethics Specialist** — all require coding understanding.  
- Coding teaches **problem-solving and logical thinking** — skills AI cannot replace.  
- In the AI era, developers who can **use AI tools effectively** will be 5x more productive.

**In short:** AI won’t take your job — but a person who knows AI might.
